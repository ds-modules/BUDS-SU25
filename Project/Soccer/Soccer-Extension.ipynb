Though data scientists often prefer the control and accuracy of controlled experiments, often performing one is either too costly or poses ethical questions (e.g., testing trial drugs and placebo treatments on cancer patients at random).

The Faroe Islands, an autonomous country of the Kingdom of Denmark, also has its own football association which is a member of UEFA.[1] The football association of Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory, was approved as a member by UEFA in 2013.[2] Kosovo was approved as a member in 2016, even though it is claimed by Serbia and is not recognised by several other UEFA member states.\n",
